Data Analyst,ICF,"Oklahoma City, OK",via Learn4Good.com,"Data Analyst Remote | Columbia, Maryland | Reston, Virginia

Ready to make a difference? We’re looking for a Data Analyst (DA) who enjoys collaborating with clients and wants to help deliver an enhanced data reporting experience. The DA will work closely with our clients to first define what their specific needs are and then to help build those custom data analytic and reporting solutions. You’ll... be an integral part of the team helping to ensure data integrity is always maintained and resolving discrepancies as they arise. 

As a demonstrated self-starter, you’ll own business processes end-to-end and will lead the identification and implementation of best practices. But you will not be alone; instead, you’ll be part of our larger team supporting utilities’ customer programs stretching across the continental U.S. This allows you to leverage the teams’ hard won best practices and approaches to guide your efforts. The growth opportunities for you will be numerous and varied since new techniques and technologies are continually entering the marketplace, needing to be evaluated and applied as appropriate.

Each day you’ll be growing and evolving your skills, helping to define and evolve your team’s best practices. Why you will love working here:
• Quality of life:
Flexible workplace arrangements, work-life balance
• Investment of the community:
Donation matching, volunteer opportunities
• Investment in you:
Tuition reimbursement, access to professional development resources, 401k matching, Employee Stock Purchase Plan
• And many, many more (Ask your recruiter for more details!)

What you will be doing:
• The DA will have the challenge to understand, define and expedite client requirements from across many different ICF teams. For each separate reporting effort, you’ll listen to what is being requested, applying your knowledge to help frame what can and should be done so each fully meets client requirements and can be developed efficiently and r input will be important so the other DA’s and developers can understand and adapt as client needs and requirements evolve.

This knowledge sharing will be accomplished through documentation materials as well as presenting findings during team meetings.
• While some interactions may require travel to facilitate successful scoping, local team deployments/trainings, and or client presentations, the DA role is not expected to require substantial travel.

What we need you to have (minimum qualifications):
• Bachelor's degree
• 3+ years of experience in a business or data analyst role utilizing Excel expertise to ensure data integrity and report quality.
• 2+ years of experience working with databases and BI tools such as Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services

What we would like you to have:
• Ability to define, document, and lead implementation of business processes and software requirements for technology initiatives
• Experience using software tools like SharePoint, JIRA, or similar systems
• Experience maintaining and rapidly producing regular reporting deliverables for a variety of audiences
• Experience with data-driven storytelling built using enhanced data presentment and data visualization techniques

At Alegeus, equally important to the What (the individual performance goals that each employee commits to in support of the company's overall success) is the How (the framework of principles that guide how we work together to drive our business forward). Overall performance success will also consider individual delivery on our corporate values:

At Alegeus, being transparent about our compensation philosophy and approach is more than just a legal requirement. As our organization continues to grow and evolve, we have made a commitment to ensure that our compensation framework is equitable, data-driven, consistent, and unbiased, with allowable pay differences based on factors unique to each candidate (think: skills, experience, qualifications, etc.) in order to attract and retain a highly talented and committed workforce.

VALUES (the How )

At Alegeus, equally important to the What (the individual performance goals that each employee commits to in support of the company's overall success) is the How (the framework of principles that guide how we work together to drive our business forward). Overall performance success will also consider individual delivery on our corporate values:
• Care personally. We connect personally to our ""why"" - are passionate and purposeful
• Put the end-user first. When we put the end user first, we believe the rest falls into place
• Consistently challenges the status quo. We believe the best solutions haven't been discovered yet
• Practice the art of inspection. We will turn over every stone to gain deeper insight to guide our actions
• Solve the real problem. We will constantly orient on the true issue at hand and accurately and fully address

The above cited duties and responsibilities describe the general nature and level of work performed by an incumbent assigned to the job. They are not intended to be an exhaustive list of all the duties and responsibilities that a candidate may be expected or asked to perform.

At Alegeus, being transparent about our compensation philosophy and approach is more than just a legal requirement. As our organization continues to grow and evolve, we have made a commitment to ensure that our compensation framework is equitable, data-driven, consistent, and unbiased, with allowable pay differences based on factors unique to each candidate (think: skills, experience, qualifications, etc.) in order to attract and retain a highly talented and committed workforce.

We are taking an inside-out approach to pay transparency by first educating our valued managers and internal workforce and then moving to publishing compensation ranges externally. In the interim, if you are a California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio or Washington resident and this role is physically available in your state or classified as remote, you may be eligible to receive additional information about the compensation and benefits for this role, which we will provide upon request.

Data Analyst,OBMedia,United States,via SimplyHired,"If you are motivated by a fast growing company where you can really make an impact, enjoy the fully-remote, small-company lifestyle, and are comfortable with the rewards and challenges of working with a diverse array of business, technical, and analytical problems, then we would love to work with you!

The Role...

OB Media is seeking a quantitative-minded professional to work in our online advertising business. If you are motivated by solving complex, multivariate problems, enjoy the small-company lifestyle, and are comfortable with the rewards and challenges of working with a diverse array of business, technical, and analytical problems, then please read on.

About the job:

Internet advertising is a marketplace. As with all marketplaces, the inefficiencies provide opportunities for arbitrage, which is our business. The Data Analyst will join a team of media buyers, technologists, account managers, and strategists, to provide a strong statistical backstop to our efforts to grow and scale our business. As Analysts mature, they are welcomed to provide insights on external business efforts, and to help us identify and test new opportunities.

Here are some examples of what Analysts may expect to have accomplished after their first year:
• Gained a comprehensive understanding of our often complex business environment, learning the Google and Microsoft marketplaces, and the skills needed to interrogate related data.
• Established repeatable testing protocols for advertising optimization, using standard techniques such as A/B and multivariate testing, constructed in such a way that they can be used by non-quantitative personnel without loss of statistical rigor.
• Contributed to the development of manual processes and automated systems, by helping design insightful statistical analyses, or predictive / prescriptive machine-learning algorithms to better solve multi-armed bandit and knapsack-style problems.
• Helped ongoing company efforts to manage our massive, often noisy, and continuously changing, data streams.

We give team members a fair degree of autonomy in accomplishing these goals. A Data Analyst might choose to research and implement a pre-existing A/B testing solution, or they might exercise their programmer brain by building a customized solution using Databricks Notebooks (Jupyter Notebooks integrated with Spark). As a small company of fairly autonomous operators, we are happy to provide the tools needed to get the job done right.

We are not fond of the tyranny of bulleted skills lists, but here are a few that would help candidates succeed:
• A degree in a STEM discipline, or a good number of related classes
• Ae'd also accept the self-taught who show strong contributions to open source projects and/or kaggle competitions
• Experience using SQL to interface with database
• Some basic understanding of internet technology
• Preference will be given to candidates with strong coding skills (Python, R, Spark, Stata, etc)

Benefits
• 100% Employer Paid Health, Dental and Vision coverage for Employees
• 401(k) at a 4% match
• 4 Weeks PTO
• Performance based bonuses

Senior Growth Analyst,Found,United States,via Simplify,"About Found

The self-employed workforce is a rapidly growing, resilient, and colorful 60 million Americans. But self-employment comes with its own set of challenges: navigating taxes, accounting, bookkeeping, and business banking are just a few. That’s where we come in...

Found is building tools that give self-employed people the security and peace of mind that has historically only been possible at big corporations. We’re a business bank account that automates taxes and expense tracking because we believe small business owners should spend more time doing what they love and less time on their business finances.

We’re looking for kind, resourceful, and passionate people to join us in building the safety net for self-employment.
About this role

Hello! I’m Shane and I lead Analytics here at Found. The Analytics team at Found covers all data, analysis, and reporting needs across the entire company. Our team plays a critical role in moving our business forward, informing and driving our nearer-term tactics, and shaping our longer-term strategy.

We’re excited to bring on another member to our team, focusing on our paid and organic acquisition efforts. You’ll work closely with our Growth, Product, and Engineering teams to identify top-of-funnel opportunities, develop methodologies to better understand and target our best customer segments, and leverage data to supercharge our growth engine.

You’ll get to dive in and immediately play a critical role by proactively identifying emerging trends and opportunities across the business. If you have any questions, feel free to include them when you apply–I personally review every application.

Day to day, you will:
• Complete deep one-off investigative analyses to better understand our users and their behavior, as well as identify new opportunities we should be considering as a company.
• Propose, design, and evaluate experiments to test hypotheses and continually improve our product experience.
• Build dashboards and reporting to empower the Growth team and the entire company with more relevant and timely information.
• Refine how we think about attribution. You’ll dive deep into our current attribution modeling, working hand-in-hand with the growth team, and own the logic and modeling behind the scenes.
• Develop a clear framework for understanding who our best customers are, where they come from, and how we can get more of them on an ongoing basis. You’ll help inform all of our acquisition efforts.
• Partner closely with our lifecycle marketing team to uplevel our email/push/sms strategy.
• Develop Found’s understanding of organic growth and take it to the next level. You’ll dive into web analytics, piece apart how different visitor segments behave downstream of a site visit, and better inform all that we’re doing to make our website better for our customers!

To thrive in this role, you have:
• 5+ years of professional experience as an analyst working closely with growth or product-focused teams.
• Deep comfort and familiarity with data analysis and experimentation--you’re a SQL wizard, have at least some familiarity with Python and have had previous experience with more complex growth & A/B test analyses.
• Experience creating complex data models from the ground up with dbt.
• Familiarity with marketing/data tools like Segment, Branch, and Google Analytics.
• Experience with defining dashboarding requirements, bringing them to life, and using them to empower teams.
• You can effectively communicate your results across a variety of technical and non-technical audiences and know how to form hypotheses about the business, dig into the data, and use the results to structure an accurate and relevant story.

You may also have
• A “Founder’s” mindset--you care deeply about what you’re a part of, you enjoy proactively diagnosing and solving problems–even if they aren’t in the job description, and thrive when creating something new by working as a team.
• Previous startup experience and/or demonstrated flexibility, initiative, and founder-focused mentality necessary to be successful in a startup environment.
• Interest or experience in accounting, bookkeeping, taxes, or self-employment.

If you are looking for a role where you will have the opportunity to make a meaningful contribution and great impact, we would love to hear from you!

Senior Data Scientist I- Adtech,InMobi,United States,via Ai-Jobs.net,"Senior Data Scientist II - Adtech Position Summary: There are 8 billion interactions a day by people with our recommendations. That’s 5 million a minute! We see the success of our models and experiments astonishingly quickly – our learning loop is not measured in weeks or days. It is hours and minutes. We live in what might be the fastest model-learning playgrounds in the world. We have built an... infrastructure that enables model deployment at scale and speed. As data scientists, we sit alongside engineering colleagues who enable our models to deploy. Combine this with our growing variable set of hundreds of potential features (and growing!), and this is a highly fertile environment for building, experimenting, refining and achieving real impact from your models. If models fire, the bottom-line impact to our teams is immediate – you see the value of your work incredibly fast. Who Are You? • The core foundation we look for is an aptitude with mathematics, and a competent ability with data science languages and tools, such as Python or Apache Spark. Most importantly, we look for a passion to investigate and learn about the world from data, to ask interesting and provocative questions, and be driven to put real models into production that drive real business value. • Basics of big data processing and cloud computing will be critical to succeed in this environment. • We are open to diverse academic backgrounds, providing an intent to think and problem-solve like a data scientist. Our team includes engineers, mathematicians, computer scientists, physicists, economists and social scientists – a rock-star data scientist can come from any academic field.

Greetings Freelancers...

I am looking for an experienced individual or team to conduct a project on ""Measuring Trends in Crime Rates Over Time"". The aim of the project is to answer the following questions:

1- What are the most common methods used to measure crime rates over time?

2- What impact does technology have on the measurement of crime trends?

3- What are some potential causes of changes in crime rates over time?

4- How do crime rates in urban areas compare to those in rural areas?

5- How have crime rates changed in the past decade?

6- How do crime rates in different countries compare, and what factors may influence these differences?

7- What role do economic and social factors play in shaping trends in crime rates over time?

8- What strategies can be used to reduce crime rates over time?

The project will require analyzing the 15 following variables(add the rest of the variables):

1- Crime Per Year (Quantitative, with values from 1990 to 2021, or any 10years time-series)

2- Crime Type (Categorical, with values of property crime, drug crimes, homicides, and violent crimes)

3- Number of Crimes per country (up to 3 countries, Quantitative with values of high, normal, low)

6- Status Status (Categorical, with values of employed and unemployed)

7- Urban/Rural Setting (Categorical, with values of urban and rural)

8- Gender (Categorical, with values of male and female)

The analysis will be done using the following techniques:

1- Crime rate VS Year = Time Series Plot

2- Demographic factors VS Crime Rate = Bar Graph

3- Status Status VS Crime Rates = Side-by-side Boxplot

4- Rural/Urban VS Crime Rates = Bar Graph

The following specific questions will also be analyzed:

Greetings Freelancers...

I am looking for an experienced individual or team to conduct a project on ""Measuring Trends in Crime Rates Over Time"". The aim of the project is to answer the following questions:

1- What are the most common methods used to measure crime rates over time?

2- What impact does technology have on the measurement of crime trends?

3- What are some potential causes of changes in crime rates over time?

4- How do crime rates in urban areas compare to those in rural areas?

5- How have crime rates changed in the past decade?

6- How do crime rates in different countries compare, and what factors may influence these differences?

7- What role do economic and social factors play in shaping trends in crime rates over time?

8- What strategies can be used to reduce crime rates over time?

The project will require analyzing the 15 following variables(add the rest of the variables):

1- Crime Per Year (Quantitative, with values from 1990 to 2021, or any 10years time-series)

2- Crime Type (Categorical, with values of property crime, drug crimes, homicides, and violent crimes)

3- Number of Crimes per country (up to 3 countries, Quantitative with values of high, normal, low)

4- Population Size (Quantitative, with values of over population, normal population, and low population)

6- Status Status (Categorical, with values of employed and unemployed)

7- Urban/Rural Setting (Categorical, with values of urban and rural)

8- Gender (Categorical, with values of male and female)

The analysis will be done using the following techniques:

1- Crime rate VS Year = Time Series Plot

2- Demographic factors VS Crime Rate = Bar Graph

3- Status Status VS Crime Rates = Side-by-side Boxplot

4- Rural/Urban VS Crime Rates = Bar Graph

The following specific questions will also be analyzed:

1- How do crime rates in urban areas compare to those in rural areas? = bar graph

2- How have crime rates changed in the past decade? = Time Series Plot

3- What are the most common methods used to measure crime rates over time? = pie chart

Data Analyst: 2023 Summer Internship,Redfin,United States,via Tarta.ai,"As a Data Analyst Intern, you’ll use some of the most robust real estate search and customer activity data in the world to build tools and answer questions that drive key business decisions across the entire company. You’ll help us turn the vagaries of human behavior into clear, specific, and thoroughly vetted recommendations for action. Redfin’s business model is unusual in its breadth, so even... simple questions will require complex logic to find an answer. You’ll have the opportunity to wrangle that complexity into clear and direct metrics, reporting, and recommendations. You’ll work on data sets ranging from thousands to hundreds of millions of records using modern tools, and develop the skills necessary for extracting meaningful human information from them. You’ll learn how to communicate analytical insights to business stakeholders effectively, as even the most insightful analysis is useless if it isn’t understood by others.

The Role
• Partner with teams across the company like Product, Engineering, and Real Estate Operations to analyze the health of our business, identifying and explaining sources of weakness and strength
• Perform targeted analyses, diving deep to answer broad questions about specific aspects of the business
• Apply the fundamentals of data visualization to build reports that are beautiful, clear, and compelling
• Craft and deliver presentations to stakeholders in other departments which go beyond simple reporting to provide recommendations about what the company should do in response to the facts

Who You Are
• Pursuing a Bachelor's, Master's, or Ph.D. degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Operations Research, Data Science, Business Analytics, an experimental science, or a related field with at least one semester/quarter remaining after internship.
• Completed coursework or other experience using SQL to aggregate data for visualization and insights
• Completed coursework or other experience with one or more of the following in a data analytics context is a plus: Tableau, PowerBI, Excel, R, Python, Postgres, Amazon Redshift
• Possessing a curiosity that doesn’t stop at the “What?” but hungers for the “Why?” and “What if?”
• Great communication skills and ability to explain complex ideas clearly to a non-technical audience

What We Offer
• Support and resources to continue learning, a brilliant team with which to collaborate, and a commitment to your career so you can grow with the company under a management team that has experience building startups into profitable, publicly traded companies
• Far more responsibility than at a big company, while at the same time far less stress than you will find in a 2-person startup
• The fruits of your labor are released every day and you'll share in our joy as we hear back from customers and national media
• A well-defined career ladder and management support to help grow your career.
• Competitive compensation packages with a salary, bonuses, restricted stock grants, and generous benefits

For Colorado applicants:

Starting Base Salary: $0.00 - 100,000.00. Actual starting base salary will depend on varying circumstances, including individual qualifications, market finances, and other operational business needs.

Benefits for Full-Time Employees: Three weeks of paid vacation, paid maternity/paternity leave, sick leave, and flex days; eligible for medical, dental, and vision insurance benefits; flexible spending account; health savings account; life and disability insurance; fertility benefits; commuter benefits; Employee Assistance Program; and 401(k).

Redfin is an equal opportunity employer committed to hiring a diverse workforce.

A diverse, inclusive culture is vital to Redfin's mission of making real estate better for people from all walks of life. We’re proud that Redfin is a place where different points of view and backgrounds are encouraged and respected.

We are a venture-backed nascent biotech-pharma company with a razor focus on solving one of the biggest problems in the industry—drugs cost too much and take too long to develop. We are transforming discovery and development of new medicines into engineering problems, shunning the costly and inefficient prevailing paradigm of trial-and-error screening. We want to solve... rare- and common diseases with gene-modulatory medicines using precise control over gene-regulatory states, typically targeting both coding and non-coding RNAs directly. The class of gene-modulatory medicines we work on are Oligonucleotide-based medicines (OBMs), which encompass antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), siRNAs, ADAR guides, aptamers etc. We envision engineering new personalized medicines immediately following actionable genetic diagnosis. Our mission is to make gene-centric medicines affordable and rapidly available to patients globally.

We are highly multi- and cross-disciplinary scientists and industry veterans. We have recruited a remarkable team of scientific advisors and early partners. We, and our investors, are committed to building a company that will disrupt the pharmaceutical industry. We value intense scientific and engineering innovation as the driver of such a change.

Data Analyst,Milu Health,United States,via SimplyHired,"WE MAKE HEALTHCARE AFFORDABLE FOR AMERICANS

Today, 112 million Americans have trouble paying for healthcare. Nearly 1 in 4 Americans have medical debt. Healthcare costs are skyrocketing, and patients are facing more of that financial burden. We started Milu Health to tackle this problem...

WHO WE ARE

Milu Health is an early stage startup focused on making healthcare affordable for Americans.

Using healthcare pricing data - a 500TB healthcare cost dataset that payers recently have had to release publicly for the first time ever - combined with other healthcare quality and claims data, we think we can change how employers and employees pay for healthcare and ultimately make high-quality medical care more affordable for patients.

Our tools comprise an operating system to reduce a patient's personal healthcare spend - from helping patients identify which high-quality and high-value doctors to go to for a procedure, to informing them about the most affordable prescription options for their medicines, to making sure their medical bills are correct. Through our entire stack, we engage patients through our consumer-facing products and cash-back incentives that can cover their out-of-pocket spend.

We're looking for the best people in the world to dig and build something great with us. It's not going to be easy. There's going to be twists and turns, successes and failures, and tons of learning. But we're in this for the long haul and believe we can fundamentally change a broken system.

Our founding team has spent the last combined 10 years building data-based healthcare businesses. Milu is backed by leading investors including a16z, Box Group, Steve Pagliuca, 81 Collection, Starting Line VC, Hypothesis Ventures and others.

THE ROLE

We're looking for a Data Analyst to join our team in our New York City or Evanston offices, or work remotely. As that data analyst, you will be responsible for querying, evaluating and understanding data outputs across all of our products, ultimately aimed at identifying cost savings opportunities and high quality medical options for patients. You will drive the scaleable analysis of data in a HIPAA-compliant environment. Ideally, you've previously done extensive healthcare claims data analysis and have experience working with CPT codes and other healthcare cost data. Most importantly, you're going to be an early data scientist on a growing team. You'll set our processes, culture and build the core infrastructure in the earliest days of the company. It's going to be a fun ride.

Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes (I&DADP) ...,MI5 / MI6,"Cheltenham, UK",via Prospects,"MI5 and MI6 are part of the UK’s Intelligence Services. Working together, we safeguard Britain’s people, interests and businesses from threats including cyber-attacks, espionage, terrorism, and organised crime. To succeed in our mission, we rely on data. On our Intelligence and Data Analyst Development Programmes (I&DADP), you’ll help shape operations, learn new skills - and build a rewarding career right at the heart of national security.
At MI5, you’ll be based in London and start on a three-month training period before carrying out three data analyst postings within the organisation. Curious and logical, you could be working in a range of different areas that help build our capability or training others to develop their analytical skills. You could also be working closely with Intelligence Officers and external partners. In every role, you’ll develop advanced data analysis techniques that’ll help to protect the UK. You’ll be taught everything you need to know on the programme, so... you don’t need to be a data expert to join – just yourself.
At MI6, you’ll join the Data Analysis Programme in Cheltenham for two years, learning how to turn raw data into vital intelligence. For the first six months, you’ll do a mix of formal and on-the-job training in technical and analytical tools. You’ll then apply this knowledge to make connections, identify trends, and solve problems as part of our investigations. Working with your analysis team and multi-agency partners, you’ll support operations and use tools you won’t find anywhere else. And once the programme finishes, you’ll have the opportunity to work in London or even abroad.
For both programmes, there’s no ‘type’ of person who works in data. It’s a job, not a label. You’ll be naturally curious, determined and genuinely interested in building a career in this field. With your attention to detail, you’ll spot things others don’t and enjoy working collaboratively. And while you don’t need coding or programming skills to join, you will have (or be expecting) a 2:2 degree in any subject or have work experience where you have demonstrated the key skills required for the role.
At MI5 and MI6 diversity and inclusion are critical to our mission. We therefore welcome and encourage applications from everyone, including those from groups that are under-represented in our workforce such as women, those from an ethnic minority background, people with disabilities and those from low socio-economic backgrounds. Find out more about our culture, working environment and diversity on our websites MI5 and MI6.

To be eligible to apply, you must be a British Citizen. If you hold dual nationality, of which one component is British, you will nonetheless be considered. Candidates must normally have been resident in the UK for seven out of the last ten years. This is particularly important if you were born outside the UK. You can apply at the age of 17 years, if successful you will not be offered a start date prior to your 18th birthday. Full eligibility details can be found on our websites MI5 and MI6",,"[{'link': 'https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=MI5+/+MI6&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwitysTExYb9AhWflWoFHc35CwwQmJACCPoK', 'text': 'See web results for MI5 / MI6'}]","['2 days ago', '£32,001–£34,500 a year', 'Full-time']",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,,2 days ago,Full-time,,,2023-02-08 18:22:26.503736,data analyst,United Kingdom

Data Analyst and Administrator,Better Futures Multi Academy Trust,"Coventry, UK",via Tes,"The opportunity

Location: Coventry/Nuneaton/ Nottingham/ Leicester with some travel between colleges required

Better Futures Multi Academy Trust (BF MAT) is looking to appoint a Data Analyst and Administrator to join the Central MAT team.

BFMAT is an ambitious and highly successful Trust of Sixth Form Colleges based in the Midlands, established in 2018 and sponsored by Coventry University. We are at an exciting stage of our journey to transform the way colleges can work together and with a university to provide excellent experiences and outcomes for our students and staff.

We are just beginning to build our understanding about what data means in the context of a Multi-Academy Trust and we have created a new role of Data Analyst and Administrator to work alongside the Senior Data Analyst to develop the Trust’s data and reporting platforms. We are looking for someone who can go beyond the collation of data and tell the story behind it, someone who is an excellent communicator and... can extract and finesse requirements from non-technical colleagues.

This is a role that requires innovation, and we are looking for someone who is self-motivated and driven to develop themselves and those around them. Someone who is comfortable in co-creating projects and systems and is reflective and open about their own vulnerabilities and development needs. ​You may already be working in post-16 education, or in a primary, secondary or higher education setting and are looking for a new challenge. You might also be working in another sector – public, private or charitable – and be looking for a new and different phase in your career. What matters to us is your commitment to our values and our goals.​

Reporting to the Senior Data Analyst, you will help design, develop and implement the Trust’s reporting platform that will provide critical insights into all aspects of the Trust’s operations. Responsibility for the technical aspects of system integration will form a major part of your role, ensuring data is where it needs to be, when it needs to be there. You will have good working knowledge of Microsoft Data technologies including SQL, SSIS, SSAS, SSRS, Power BI along with sound knowledge of new and evolving technologies.

The Trust is committed to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of all students in our care and expects all staff and volunteers to share this commitment.

Do you have an excellent understanding of techniques for data analysis, familiarity with data science and data warehousing techniques and a solid knowledge of GDPR and national data protection laws? Then join Shelter Scotland as a Data Analyst and you could soon be playing a key role at the heart of our Scottish Empty Homes Partnership team.

About Shelter Scotland

A home is a fundamental human need, as essential as education or healthcare. Yet over a million people in Scotland struggle on a daily basis with homelessness, bad housing conditions, soaring rents, discrimination and the threat of eviction. So, we are striving for change, with individuals, in communities, across... society, and leading the way to a safe home. We need ambitious, best-in-class individuals who are passionate about our cause to join us at this exciting time. This is your chance to play a part in the fundamental change we are striving to achieve.

At Shelter Scotland we are united by our purpose to defend the right to a safe home. Our enemy is the social injustice at the core of the escalating housing emergency. We believe that to win that fight, we must be representative of the people we are here to help and those who support our movement for change. In all our people decisions, we take pride in being inclusive, fair, equitable and transparent.

We have committed to combat racism both within and outside Shelter Scotland and welcome you on our journey to becoming a truly anti-racist organisation.

About the team

Part of our Communications and Advocacy directorate, the Scottish Empty Homes Partnership (SEHP) is funded by Scottish Government and hosted by Shelter Scotland. Our aim is to bring as many privately-owned empty homes back into use (as social and affordable homes where possible), by meeting a number of key strategic objectives. These include encouraging every council to mainstream empty homes work, encouraging registered social landlords, community groups and other private bodies to engage in empty homes work and delivering a Scottish Empty Homes Advice Service.

About the role

As part of a Housing to 2040 paper published in 2021, the Scottish Government is committed to carrying out an audit of empty homes across Scotland. Accordingly, the main focus of this role will be to work with colleagues in the SEHP to support delivery of that audit. But that's not all. We're also looking to develop a suite of reports that can help to monitor and assess the performance of the partnership against our key objectives and provide ongoing analysis and insight of empty homes and other related housing data. Your challenge will be to support this in collaboration with our Policy and Projects Manager and others in the team. Assisting with primary data collection, reviewing data storage, playing your part in internal quality assurance procedures and producing bespoke reports - these are just some aspects of this interesting and varied role.

About you

To succeed, you'll need strong analytical skills, including a flair for interpreting and analysing diverse sources of complex information at pace. You'll also need to be well-organised, with a proven ability to sort through complex information

and experience of configuring, implementing and maintaining technical reporting solutions using associated Microsoft technologies and SQL databases - Office 365 etc. Proficiency using tools and languages such as Excel and Power BI is important too, as are the communication skills required to produce high-quality written reports, data visualisation and presentations, plus experience of presenting your findings to groups.

Benefits

We offer a wide range of benefits, including 30 days of annual leave, enhanced family friendly policies, pension and interest free travel loans. Our employees also have access to a tenancy deposit loan, payroll giving, cycle to work scheme and an employee assistance programme.

Shelter Scotland helps over half a million people every year struggling with bad housing or homelessness through our advice, support and legal services. And we campaign to make sure that, one day, no one will have to turn to us for help.

To find out more about the role and the benefits of working for Shelter Scotland please visit our website. Apply to be part of our team and be the change you want to see in society.

Safeguarding is everyone's business. Shelter is committed to protecting the health, wellbeing and human rights of those we support, and enabling them to live free from harm, abuse and neglect.

Data Analyst,Octopus Energy,"England, UK",via AngelList,"Help us make a big green dent in the universe. We're on a mission to drive the global renewable energy revolution, and we need loads more people to help us make our vision a reality.

We're looking for someone who will work in our credit risk function and develop our capabilities across both business and consumer portfolios.

This could not be a better time to join Octopus Energy. We are already recognised as a global leader in the fight to decarbonise the planet by revolutionising what’s possible in energy - including investments in renewable energy supply, renewable energy generation, smart energy networks, EVs, heat pumps, etc. The government's new green initiatives and the recent investment by Al Gore’s Generation Fund will propel us further and faster. Equally, from a credit risk perspective this is an important time to join. The energy sector has gone through a period of volatility. Businesses and households are facing significantly higher energy prices just as we enter winter... This situation is compounded with the end of furlough and reductions to Universal Credit payments. For these reasons we are looking to add to our credit risk capabilities with this new role.

What you'll do
• Take ownership of our credit strategies for residential and business customers
• Develop our credit scorecards
• Payments and payment adequacy strategy
• Collections insight and strategy
• Develop our empathic approaches towards vulnerable customers
• Credit risk reporting and management information
• Strategies to identify and prevent first party and third party fraud
• Bad debt provision and write-offs
• Do all the above in partnership with Data Science, Finance, Collections, Ops and other stakeholders

What you'll have
• Excellent SQL skills
• Python data science stack experience (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, Jupyter notebooks, Plotly/matplotlib)
• Git for version control experience
• Data visualization tool experience (Tableau, Looker, PowerBI or equivalent)
• Experience of consumer credit risk and collections is ideal but not essential
• DBT experience a bonus but not essential

Why else you'll love it here
• Wondering what the salary for this role is? Just ask us! On a call with one of our recruiters it's something we always cover as we genuinely want to match your experience with the correct salary. The reason why we don't advertise is because we honestly have a degree of flexibility and would never want salary to be a reason why someone doesn't apply to Octopus - what's more important to us is finding the right octofit!
• Octopus Energy is a unique culture. An organisation where people learn, decide, and build quicker. Where people work with autonomy, alongside a wide range of amazing co-owners, on projects that break new ground. We want your hard work to be rewarded with perks you actually care about! We won best company to work for in 2022, on Glassdoor we were voted 50 best places to work in 2022 and our Group CEO, Greg has recorded a podcast about our culture and how we empower our people

Data Analyst,Octopus Energy,"England, UK",via AngelList,"Help us make a big green dent in the universe. We're on a mission to drive the global renewable energy revolution, and we need loads more people to help us make our vision a reality.

We're looking for someone who will work in our credit risk function and develop our capabilities across both business and consumer portfolios.

This could not be a better time to join Octopus Energy. We are already recognised as a global leader in the fight to decarbonise the planet by revolutionising what’s possible in energy - including investments in renewable energy supply, renewable energy generation, smart energy networks, EVs, heat pumps, etc. The government's new green initiatives and the recent investment by Al Gore’s Generation Fund will propel us further and faster. Equally, from a credit risk perspective this is an important time to join. The energy sector has gone through a period of volatility. Businesses and households are facing significantly higher energy prices just as we enter winter... This situation is compounded with the end of furlough and reductions to Universal Credit payments. For these reasons we are looking to add to our credit risk capabilities with this new role.

What you'll do
• Take ownership of our credit strategies for residential and business customers
• Develop our credit scorecards
• Payments and payment adequacy strategy
• Collections insight and strategy
• Develop our empathic approaches towards vulnerable customers
• Credit risk reporting and management information
• Strategies to identify and prevent first party and third party fraud
• Bad debt provision and write-offs
• Do all the above in partnership with Data Science, Finance, Collections, Ops and other stakeholders

What you'll have
• Excellent SQL skills
• Python data science stack experience (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, Jupyter notebooks, Plotly/matplotlib)
• Git for version control experience
• Data visualization tool experience (Tableau, Looker, PowerBI or equivalent)
• Experience of consumer credit risk and collections is ideal but not essential
• DBT experience a bonus but not essential

Why else you'll love it here
• Wondering what the salary for this role is? Just ask us! On a call with one of our recruiters it's something we always cover as we genuinely want to match your experience with the correct salary. The reason why we don't advertise is because we honestly have a degree of flexibility and would never want salary to be a reason why someone doesn't apply to Octopus - what's more important to us is finding the right octofit!

Where people work with autonomy, alongside a wide range of amazing co-owners, on projects that break new ground. We want your hard work to be rewarded with perks you actually care about!

Co-op Academy Belle Vue offers something a little different from other schools, whether that be the structure of the day, our investment in technology, or our diverse and exciting ‘electives programme’.

When we opened our doors to our first cohort of staff and students, we welcomed a new generation of Co-op pioneers, and together we have built something really... special. Although the academy started its life in brand new, custom-built accommodation on the site of Co-op Connell College, we have now moved into our new state of the art academy building on Hyde Road.
